            <h5>Baking</h5>
            <P>Baking is my form of culinary artistry. 
               I love the process of combining ingredients, watching them transform in the oven, 
               and the delightful aroma that fills the kitchen. There's a sense of accomplishment in creating something delicious from scratch. 
               My love for baking started with simple cookies and brownies, but over time, I've ventured into more complex recipes like sourdough bread and multi-layered cakes.
               Experimenting with flavors and decorations allows me to express my creativity. 
               Sharing my baked goods with family and friends is one of my greatest joys, as it brings smiles and creates lasting memories.
            </P>

           <h2>Reading Quotes</h2><br>
           <p>Quotes have a way of capturing profound truths in just a few words. 
            They inspire me, offer comfort during tough times, and remind me of the values I hold dear. 
            I have a collection of quotes that I turn to for motivation and reflection. For example,
            "The only way to do great work is to love what you do," by Steve Jobs,
            encourages me to pursue my passions wholeheartedly. Another favorite is, "In the end, 
            we only regret the chances we didn't take," by Lewis Carroll, which pushes me to step out of my comfort zone and seize opportunities. "Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions," by the Dalai Lama, reminds me that joy comes from within and is shaped by our choices and attitudes. 
            These quotes, among others, guide me in my personal and professional life.

            <h5>Music</h5>
            <P>Music is an integral part of my life, a universal language that speaks to the soul and transcends boundaries.
               Among the many genres I enjoy, qasidah music holds a special place in my heart. 
               This traditional form of Islamic devotional music, with its poetic lyrics and soothing melodies, 
               has been a source of spiritual upliftment and comfort for me.
            </P>
            <p>
               Qasidah music, rooted in the rich cultural heritage of the Islamic world, often features lyrical poetry that praises the Prophet Muhammad, 
               celebrates Islamic values, and conveys deep spiritual messages. The rhythmic patterns and melodic structures create
               an atmosphere of tranquility and reflection, allowing listeners to connect with their faith on a profound level.
               Whether a classic qasidah ensemble or contemporary renditions, the music never ceases to move me. 
               It gives me inspiration and a sense of calm while bringing to mind the principles and customs that form the foundation of my identity. 
               I think qasidah is a beautiful synthesis of art. 
               It is truly a treasure that holds a special place in my heart.
            </p>
            <p>I have put one of qasidah that i love to listen, so anyone can listen it too and will absolutely love it.</p>

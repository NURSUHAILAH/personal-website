            <h5>Primary School</h5>
            <P>After i"m passed my kindergarten life which just live happily without having any problems,
                i continiue my study at Sekolah Kebangsaan  Kukusan, Tawau Sabah.
                After seven years, my family and I moved at Kedah, then I'm continue back my study at Sekolah Kebangsaan Taman Seri Wang
                I'm an active student there which I love involving myself in many activities.
                One of the biggest achievement that I have got is second place in Kalam Jamai'e competition.
                it was the sweetest moment ever that my teams love. We do our best by training everyday and it worked.
                Then, in 2016, I'm taking my UPSR paper and ended my childhood era there happily.

            <h2>Degree</h2><br>
            <p>Attending UiTM Kedah has been an exciting and transformative chapter in my life.
               The diverse academic environment has allowed me to delve deeply into my field of study, surrounded by passionate peers and inspiring professors.
               Beyond the classroom, university life has offered countless opportunities for personal growth and community involvement.
               One of the most rewarding experiences has been participating in a volunteer program at Jam Besar in Sungai Petani, 
               where I contributed to "Sungai Petani Berselawat". This program not only allowed me to give back to the community
               but also taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, leadership, and empathy. My time at UiTM Kedah has been instrumental 
               in shaping my future aspirations and broadening my horizons.
